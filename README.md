# Labrador

Pull secrets from remote services into CI/CD pipelines.

Labrador is a CLI tool to fetch variables and secrets from remote
services. The primary use case is enabling secretless pipelines,
where secrets are dynamically fetched instead of statically stored.

Values are recursively pulled from one or more services, and output
to the terminal or a file.

Labrador is focused on pulling values, not on managing or writing values.

## Environment Variables

### AWS

For Labrador to access secrets stored in AWS, configure the region and one
of the authentication methods. When running in a CI pipeline, a step may
configure some of these variables automatically, like the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` Github Action.

- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_PROFILE`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
